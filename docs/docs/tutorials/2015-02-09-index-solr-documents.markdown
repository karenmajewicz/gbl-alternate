### Overview

GeoBlacklight uses the GeoBlacklight Schema, Version 1.0 as a template for metadata documents indexed by Solr.

GeoBlacklight provides a rake task to index documents as fixtures for tests. We will use this rake task to index several documents as an example.

### Download fixture metadata documents

  1. Assuming that you have already navigated to the directory of your GeoBlacklight app, create a directory for some Solr documents and then move to it:

     ```sh
     $ mkdir -p spec/fixtures/solr_documents && cd spec/fixtures/solr_documents
     ```

  1. Download some metadata documents (in JSON format) to the directory

     ```sh
     $ curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mejackreed/84abc598927c43af665b/raw/geoblacklight-documents.json
     ```

  1. Move back to app root directory

     ```sh
     $ cd - # Or cd ../../../
     ```

  1. Make sure your Solr server and Rails application are started.

     ```sh
     $ rake geoblacklight:server
     ```

  1. *Optional* Commit your work

     ```sh
     $ git add .
     $ git commit -m 'Adds in JSON fixtures'
     ```

The fixtures directory is useful for quickly indexing a small number documents in Solr (built specifically for populating Solr for testing). I would caution though in using this task for large scale indexing and committing, as we've developed other best practices for production-scale indexing.
