## Setting up your environment
  - Development requirements
  - Local attendees setup VirtualBox/Vagrant

### Development requirements

GeoBlacklight has similar prerequisites to [Blacklight][bldependencies]. It diverges from Blacklight requirements by using a customized Solr schema and configuration, [Geoblacklight Schema, Version 1.0](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/blob/master/schema/geoblacklight-schema.md).

#### Software you should have installed on your development computer

  - [Ruby > 2.6.6][installruby]
  - [Rails > 6.0][installrails]
  - [Git][installgit]
  - [Java > 1.8][installjava] (Download JDK for local Solr server)
  - [Node.js > 14.15 LTS][installnode]
  - [Yarn > 1.13][installyarn]

It is recommended to install the latest versions of Ruby, Rails, and Node.js. We strive to keep GeoBlacklight updated with these versions. A great, almost always up-to-date, tutorial on getting a Ruby on Rails development environment is available here: [https://gorails.com/setup](https://gorails.com/setup). If you are not following this tutorial as part of an in person workshop, you can skip to the next section once you have these dependencies installed.
{: .flash-alert}

Local attendees of the workshop have the option of just using the pre-created environment on the provided thumb-drive. **Note:** You can complete this tutorial without Vagrant as long as you already have the above mentioned software on your machine. If you do, you may skip ahead to <a href="{% post_url 2015-02-09-create-your-application %}">Part 3 - Create your application</a>

Also, if you are not at the workshop (or perhaps if you want to prepare your own environment for a workshop you are facilitating), you can create the virtual machine for the workshop, by following [this guide]({% post_url 2016-01-23-using-packer-to-create-a-development-virtual-machine %}).

### In-person attendees setup VirtualBox/Vagrant
  
Good news for in-person workshop participants: the process of setting up your environment has already done for you using VirtualBox and Vagrant. On the thumb-drive underneath a directory titled 'geoblacklight_workshop'. Thanks to Justin Coyne and [Data Curation Experts](http://curationexperts.com/) for this approach that is used at HydraCamps.

For those interested in what was installed on this machine and how it was created checkout [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mejackreed/727e9cd2e971ca3949a2).

 - [Vagrant for Windows](#vagrant-for-windows)

#### Vagrant Quick Tips
After you have your virtual machine up and going, you will want to stop it. Here are a few commands that will help out.

```sh
$ vagrant halt # stops the virtual machine
$ vagrant destroy # stops and deletes the virtual machine
```

#### Vagrant for OS X and Linux
  1. Install the Mac (.dmg) version of VirtualBox and Vagrant on your machine. If you are using Linux, please download and install appropriately. [VirtualBox Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), [Vagrant Downloads](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

  1. If not already on your Desktop, copy the `geoblacklight_workshop` directory to your `~/Desktop` directory

  1. Move to your `~/Desktop/geoblacklight_workshop` directory
 
     ```sh
     $ cd ~/Desktop/geoblacklight_workshop
     ```

  1. Start vagrant

     ```sh
     $ vagrant up # This command creates and configures guest machines according to your Vagrantfile.
     ```

  1. SSH to the VM

     ```sh
     $ vagrant ssh # This will SSH into a running Vagrant machine and give you access to a shell.
     ```

#### Vagrant for Windows

Thanks to Zach Vowell who contributed this guide for Windows.

Note: Please install a Windows ssh client installed such as [ PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).

  1. Install the Windows (.exe) version of VirtualBox and Vagrant on your machine.

  1. If not already on your Desktop, copy the `geoblacklight_workshop` directory to your Desktop `C:\Users\[username]\Desktop` (for Windows 7)

  1. Open a [Windows Command Prompt (cmd)](http://www.digitalcitizen.life/7-ways-launch-command-prompt-windows-7-windows-8)

  1. Move to the `geoblacklight_workshop` directory on the Desktop

     ```
     C:\Users\[username]> cd Desktop\geoblacklight_workshop
     ```

  1. Start Vagrant

     ```
     C:\Users\[username]\Desktop\geoblacklight_workshop> vagrant up
     # This command creates and configures guest machines according to your Vagrantfile.
     ```

  1. Open up PuTTY

  1. SSH into the Vagrant box by entering the following parameters into the "Basic Options for Your PuTTY session" window:
    - Host Name (or IP address): 127.0.0.1
    - Port: 2222

  1. When PuTTY shell prompts for a username and password, enter "vagrant" for both. You should now see a command prompt.
