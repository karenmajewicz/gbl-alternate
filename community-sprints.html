  <p>
  The GeoBlacklight Community collaborates on a 2-week sprint every Winter and Summer. Participation in the sprint is open to anyone interested in working on GeoBlacklight. While similar to a traditional code sprint, the GeoBlacklight Community Sprints also include tackling issues around documentation, metadata, community governance, and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each sprint starts with a kickoff meeting where we review our goals and volunteer to contribute towards various issues. This is then followed by short standup meetings every day to check-in and plan our next activities. The exact dates of a sprint are determined the season prior to the sprint. If you are interested in participating, visit the <a href="/connect.html">Connect page</a> to join our community.
